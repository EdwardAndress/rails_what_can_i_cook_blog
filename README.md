-----------------------------------------

####Specification:
 * This simple blogging site should
  * Allow a user to register
  * Allow a registered user to log in
  * Allow a logged in user to make text-based blog posts about their pantry/fridge contents
  * Allow another user to reply with culinary ideas
 * Extra functionality might appear one day which
  * Allows one user to 'follow' another
  * Allows users to customise the aesthetics of their personal pages

####This kata is good for:
 * Learbing how to set up Rails
 * Learning how to use databases within Rails
 
###But, it's not ready yet... So...

####(Don't) Set it up:
```sh
$ git clone anything_other_than_this
```

####Test ~~it~~ something else:
```sh
$ cd whatever_you_cloned
$ rspec
```
